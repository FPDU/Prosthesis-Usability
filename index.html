<h3>
<a id="training-time" class="anchor" href="#training-time" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Training Time</strong>
</h3>

<p>It may take you some time to learn to use the new prostheses. It may take you as little as one week to become comfortable using some of the new prostheses. It may take you as long as two months to become comfortable using some others.</p>


<h3>
<a id="ability-to-do-daily-tasks" class="anchor" href="#ability-to-do-daily-tasks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Ability to do daily tasks</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may be able to do new tasks with some new prostheses. These may include self-care tasks. They may include everyday household or office tasks. For other new prostheses, you may not be able to do some tasks you can do with a current prosthesis.</p>

<h3>
<a id="difficulty-of-doing-daily-tasks" class="anchor" href="#difficulty-of-doing-daily-tasks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Difficulty of doing daily tasks</strong>
</h3>

<p>With some new prostheses, some of your daily tasks may be easier to do. For other new prostheses, some of your daily tasks may be harder to do.</p>

<h3>
<a id="speed-of-doing-daily-tasks" class="anchor" href="#speed-of-doing-daily-tasks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Speed of doing daily tasks</strong>
</h3>

<p>With some new prostheses, you may be able to do some of your daily tasks faster. For other new prostheses, you may do some of your daily tasks more slowly.</p>
      
<h3>
<a id="compatibility-with-terminal-devices" class="anchor" href="#compatibility-with-terminal-devices" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Compatibility with terminal devices</strong>
</h3>

<p>The terminal device on a prosthesis is the part that is used like a hand. Some of the new prostheses may only have one option for the terminal device. Other new prostheses may let you change between more than one terminal device. For example, you may have access to different types of hands and grippers.</p>

</h3>

<p>Whether the prosthesis will break down in different conditions. Some new prostheses will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to get wet</li>
<li>Work well even in a dry climate</li>
<li>Work well even when dirt gets on them</li>
<li>Continue to work even when they are hit repeatedly or used to pound on something repeatedly</li>
</ul>
